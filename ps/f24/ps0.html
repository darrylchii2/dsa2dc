<h1 class="title">DSA2: Problem Set 0</h1>
</header>
<p>This problem set is intended to help you to get set up with LaTeX (Overleaf). Like future PSs, you will be asked to submit the pdf that is generated from the LaTeX file.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-latex">Getting Started with LaTeX</h2>
<p>LaTeX is essentially a programming language for documents. It’s the most powerful and widely-used tool for producing highly-readable documents with combinations of code, pseudo-code, mathematics, figures, etc. We will be using it for all written homework assignments (PS’s) this semester.</p>
<h3 id="register-for-overleaf">Register for Overleaf</h3>
<p>While you’re welcome to use any LaTeX tool that you’d like, we highly recommend using Overleaf. To use this tool, first visit <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" class="uri">https://www.overleaf.com</a> and register an account (if you don’t already have one). UVA has a site license, so if you register with your <span class="citation" data-cites="virginia.edu">@virginia.edu</span> email address you will have full access to all the Overleaf features for free.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-your-project">Set Up Your Project</h3>
<p>You will have a separate Overleaf project for each exercise. The easiest way to set up the repository is to upload the zip file posted with each exercise. To do this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the <a href="ps0.zip">ps0.zip</a> file. This zip file contains both the ps0.tex file and the dsa2.sty style file.</li>
<li>In Overleaf, click on Create First Project or New Project and select Upload Project from the menu.</li>
<li>Select the ps0.zip file you downloaded in step 1.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="editing-the-latex-template">Editing The LaTeX Template</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add your information to the top of the file:
<ul>
<li><code>yourid</code> - Replace <code>mst3k</code> with your computing id</li>
<li><code>collabs</code> - Add your collaborators here</li>
<li><code>sources</code> - Reference any sources you used when completing this assignment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then, try rebuilding the PDF by clicking Recompile. You should see a file that includes your name and collaborators.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modify the ps0.tex file to complete each problem. To see an example of what your submission might look like, see <a href="ps0-target.pdf">this pdf</a>. You should verbatim reproduce the proof seen there for problem 2.
<ul>
<li>Learn how to include drawings in your documents with the includegraphics{file} command by including an image of your choosing (it doesn’t matter what the image is) in the same pdf. Make sure the entire image fits on a single page. You may need to resize the image.</li>
<li>Submit the generated <strong>pdf</strong> (NOT a .tex or .zip file) to Gradescope.</li>
<li>Match Problems to Pages - When you submit your pdf to Gradescope, you will be shown a “Question Outline” and be prompted to “Select a question or a page”. Click on the first problem (usually labeled “1 Problem 1”), then choose the page (or pages) of the pdf file on which your answer appears. Repeat for each question listed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
