title: "DSA2: Readings"
---

Below are the readings for DSA2.  These reading are optional, but many find them useful -- either as pre-reads or as review.  All readings are from [CLRS, 4th edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/026204630X), which you can view for free via [this link to the UVA library](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy1.library.virginia.edu/lib/UVA/detail.action?docID=6925615).

To see what reading is for what lecture, you can look ahead at the next set of slides in the posted slide sets -- we might go through 30 or so slides in a given lecture.  Then match the topics that are in those slides with the topics below.

DISCLAIMER: Some of these readings may change as we approach a given lecture.  But we do not expect there to be significant changes.

- Review: 
	- CLRS Chapter 2: insertion sort (if needed), book's pseudo-code conventions
	- CLRS Chapter 3: info on order-class (more than we cover in lecture), math review
	- Note: book goes into more depth than we do, and topics we don't need.  Use it to reinforce what's taught in lectures.
